After reading  the novel by Lois Duncan I felt that it may have deviated from the original story a bit too much.  Nevertheless, Jennifer Love Hewitt gave an incredible performance.  I do feel though that too  many characters got killed in it.  Should have kept some for the sequal.  END  \n",

For those of you familiar with the 1971 Roman Polanski version, Welles  brought to the screen a darker, more nightmarish world than Polanski could envision.  The lighting is stark and the shadows ominous.  Macbeth's madness increasingly pervades the atmosphere of the entire film, making the viewer un...  \n",
